There’s also an\r\noption to dig a bit deeper and prepare a prototype by ASHRAE that uses live\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nIf you are available, I would love to meet this week to discuss what our\r\ndesign partnership might look like moving forward.

The issues are due to:\r\n\r\n   - invalid Department of Workforce Services Account Number for Department\r\n   of Workforce Services\r\n   - invalid State Tax Commission Account Number for State Tax Commission\r\n\r\nIf these issues aren't resolved, the 2 agencies may assess penalties and\r\ninterest for which you'll be liable. We'll also be unable to complete your\r\ntax filings, so as a precaution, your payroll will be blocked in 13 days.\r\n13 days\r\n\r\nuntil payroll is blocked\r\n\r\n*How do I fix this?*\r\n\r\n   1.

So we want to make sure you know a few other things:\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    1. This doesn't account for equity. In addition to that\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    initial salary, we also expect to be able to offer you equity currently\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    worth 1.4% of the company. This will vest over 4 years - the same vesting\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    schedule for all equity holding leaders.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    2. As we discussed, this will be meaningful equity. The\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    strike price on these options will be very low since things are still so\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    early on in fundraising. And with the team we have in place, the incredible\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    investors already backing us, and the vision / opportunity that we're\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    building towards, we believe we have something special with enormous\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    upside. It is exactly why I am not taking any salary until our Seed round\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    -- because I wanted more equity for long term value.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    3. We can also ensure in any employment agreement that, once\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    we raise the Seed, we can seek to adjust your salary higher. We can use the\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    same language that we included in our agreement with our Head of Marketing\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    4. We provide competitive health insurance benefits in the\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    U.S. through Gusto. We are also absolutely fine with you taking personal or\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    family time off as needed, as long as it is reasonable and doesn't impact\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>    the overall quality of your work\r\n>>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>>> Please take some time to think through things, and we're always\r\n>>>>>>>>>>> reachable via phone / whatsapp / in person (until Sunday afternoon) to\r\n>>>>>>>>>>> answer any questions.

And while according to that this\r\n>>>>>>>>>> salary would be in the 75th percentile or higher for Seed-Stage, C-Level\r\n>>>>>>>>>> Product / Design Officers... we do completely understand how this is lower\r\n>>>>>>>>>> than what you have been seeing.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>> However, we do think you are a perfect fit for who we're looking\r\n>>>>>>>>>> to lead all of our product design, and build out this division well into\r\n>>>>>>>>>> the future. So we want to make sure you know a few other things:\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    1. This doesn't account for equity. In addition to that\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    initial salary, we also expect to be able to offer you equity currently\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    worth 1.4% of the company. This will vest over 4 years - the same vesting\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    schedule for all equity holding leaders.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    2. As we discussed, this will be meaningful equity. The\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    strike price on these options will be very low since things are still so\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    early on in fundraising. And with the team we have in place, the incredible\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    investors already backing us, and the vision / opportunity that we're\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    building towards, we believe we have something special with enormous\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    upside. It is exactly why I am not taking any salary until our Seed round\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    -- because I wanted more equity for long term value.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    3. We can also ensure in any employment agreement that, once\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    we raise the Seed, we can seek to adjust your salary higher. We can use the\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    same language that we included in our agreement with our Head of Marketing\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    4. We provide competitive health insurance benefits in the\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    U.S. through Gusto. We are also absolutely fine with you taking personal or\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    family time off as needed, as long as it is reasonable and doesn't impact\r\n>>>>>>>>>>    the overall quality of your work\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>> Please take some time to think through things, and we're always\r\n>>>>>>>>>> reachable via phone / whatsapp / in person (until Sunday afternoon) to\r\n>>>>>>>>>> answer any questions. And if you need anything else from us to make a\r\n>>>>>>>>>> more thoughtful decision, happy to send you investor decks, the investor\r\n>>>>>>>>>> update we sent about 6 weeks ago, or our investor list.\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>> Hope you are as excited as we are about this Leadership Role to\r\n>>>>>>>>>> help us build and scale Bigfoot into everything we know it can be!\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>> Best,\r\n>>>>>>>>>> Alex, JC, and Shane\r\n>>>>>>>>>> --\r\n>>>>>>>>>> *Alex Ward | **Co-Founder*\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>> US / Whatsapp: +1 202 9049585\r\n>>>>>>>>>> EU: +34 627 297013\r\n>>>>>>>>>> MeetBigfoot.com\r\n>>>>>>>>>>\r\n>>>>>>>>>\r\n"

I trust you’ve already\r\naccounted for the implications of your absence. :) As for my offense, I am\r\nhappy to share as much detail as necessary. Here’s the short version:\r\n\r\nMy first job out of college was teaching Graphic Design at the high school\r\nI graduated from. One of my students—who was and is a close friend of my\r\nlittle sister—and I had what I thought was an inappropriate relationship. I\r\nwas lying to myself and the reality is I committed sexual assault since I\r\nwas 23 and she was 16. I disclosed this truth to the head of the school\r\nwhich led to my immediate dismissal. Though the victim and her parents did\r\nnot want to press charges, the state was obligated to prosecute since I was\r\nin a position of authority. I was formally charged in July 2010 and\r\naccepted a plea in April 2011 to serve no jail time, register as a sex\r\noffender, and attend 30 months of group therapy. I met all requirements of\r\nmy sentence and I have remained in good standing with local law enforcement\r\nfor over 10 years now.\r\n\r\nThere are many in my life now who were close to me then who would be\r\nwilling to share a character recommendation letter if necessary. Thank you\r\nfor taking the time to navigate this for me, Kris! Let me know if you need\r\nanything else.\r\n\r\nTalk soon,\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn Tue, May 17, 2022 at 9:35 AM Kris Niles <kris@buildbook.co> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hey Matt!\r\n> Really great connecting with you yesterday!

It looks like you are now a\r\nJudge - Congratulations!\r\n\r\nWe relocated to Utah a few years ago and have three little girls of our\r\nown. We have been fortunate to not have felt restricted by too many things\r\nwith Matt's conviction / RSO status. With our oldest being in public school\r\nfor the first time this fall, we are starting to see some complications.\r\nFor example, there is a \"Dads and Donuts\" event and a Parent-Teacher\r\nConference this week. Instead of trying to be sneaky, Matt reached out to\r\nthe Principle to introduce himself and see about getting permission to be\r\non grounds with our daughter for special events. He was very kind and went\r\nfurther up into the district to see what exceptions could be made. The DA\r\nsent over the textbook law for RSO on school grounds and said it's not\r\npermitted. He did suggest Matt could try to get a court approved permission\r\nfor this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nA few questions we are wondering:\r\n\r\n-What type of lawyer would we hire to represent us for something like this?\r\nAssuming it would need to be done in a Utah court?\r\n\r\n-We have talked for years about attempting to have his conviction sealed,\r\nnow that he's been in good standing for more than 10 years. Any suggestions\r\non who we could work with to go about that?\r\n\r\nI appreciate any input you can offer. Feel free to call us if that's easier\r\nfor you!\r\n\r\nMatthew and Megan Born\r\n(309) 657-3798\r\n"

As you generate the numbers programmatically, will we be able to get\r\n   the trend for each treatment and control value as well?

Do you know if Portico has disability data or should I plan to\r\n   exclude that?\r\n   3. Are there any other sections I should plan to exclude b/c Portico\r\n   doesn’t have data for it?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jun 8, 2021 at 9:41 PM Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Thanks for your update on this, Mike!

Sometimes deep conversations late in the\r\nweek can be extra taxing, yet I felt uniquely refreshed by your energy and\r\noptimism around how holistic experience design can help mature your\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nYou asked for portfolio examples, so here’s a case study from my last\r\nin-house role at Artemis Health.\r\n<https://mattborn.com/work/for/artemis/> Interestingly\r\nenough, Artemis is one of our active clients. Just met with their head of\r\nproduct this morning. Since Moona is a new business, we haven’t published\r\nany case studies, yet. I’d be happy to walk you through a recent project\r\nover Zoom to show you how we use daily design sprints to convert empirical\r\nuser research into design patterns and testable prototypes.\r\n\r\nIf you are still interested in getting a jump on that June 14 start date, I\r\nam open to contracting some hours directly in the meantime if it’s easier\r\nto get that rolling while we work out the details of a long-term playbook\r\nthat involves my team.\r\n\r\nI am extremely grateful to know such passionate and driven product leaders\r\nlike you and Jon.

Sprout will be issuing each equity\r\nholder a W-2 tax form for their equity compensation received in January of\r\n2020; therefore, Sprout will be remitting your required local and federal\r\ntax liability on your behalf.  What does this mean for you?\r\n\r\nYou will be receiving a W-2 tax form for the 2020 tax year by January 31,\r\n2021 which will report your total equity compensation amount, as well as\r\nlocal and federal tax amounts remitted on your behalf from Sprout:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   US Federal Income Tax Withholding: $5,700.90\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   State Income Tax Withholding: $1,282.70\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Other State tax, if applicable (SUI/SDI/PFML): $0.00\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Social Security Withholding: $1,606.62\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Medicare Withholding: $375.74\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Total tax due: $8,965.95\r\n\r\n\r\nSince we are remitting taxes on your behalf, you will need to arrange\r\nrepayment of your required tax liability to Sprout Social by January 31,\r\n2021 and have attached payment instructions on how to do so.\r\n\r\nInstructions on how and where to remit payment by check, wire or ACH are\r\nlisted below.\r\n\r\nPlease reach out to Equity@sproutsocial.com with any questions.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSprout Equity team\r\n\r\nIf you are sending an electronic payment (wire or ACH), please use the\r\nfollowing bank information:\r\n\r\nAccount Name:       SPROUT SOCIAL, INC.\r\n\r\n131 S DEARBORN ST SUITE 700\r\n\r\nCHICAGO IL 60603\r\n\r\nAccount Number:   3302297531\r\n\r\nRouting Number:    121-140-399\r\n\r\nSwift Code:              SVBKUS6S\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are sending a check, please send to Sprout Social’s lockbox at the\r\nfollowing remittance address:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSprout Social, Inc.\r\n\r\nDept.

Google Workspace Support, Andrei: Most\r\n> likely your Google Voice was a legacy account on which we do not offer\r\n> anymore, Matt. And it is separate with G Suite. Which is why there is no\r\n> history here on your account. Matt Born: Also, I was under the impression\r\n> “as long as you use it to communicate between your Google Voice number and\r\n> other U.S. numbers, it’s totally free to place calls and send text\r\n> messages.” Is that no longer true?

Google\r\n> Workspace Support, Andrei: If you paid for the service then you will also\r\n> get the features included with it. No need. You can sign up for Google\r\n> Voice using your account.

Re: their mood boards, the\r\nfirst page depicts logos but the second page depicts the logo being used\r\nwithin branding. Just to be clear, these would be separate projects. Once\r\nwe have the logo designed we can create additional branded designs (like\r\nthe hands holding the logo, etc). Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nOur logo pricing for a ministry is $499 with the client agreeing to the\r\nbelow expectations. Slides, ID's, or branded designs run $199-299 depending\r\non each project.\r\n\r\nWe have an intake form to fill out where the client can provide information\r\n(similar to what they've already provided) to have a clear desire for the\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nBased on what they've provided in the mood boards I think we can make them\r\nhappy!

Right now, the first 5 dials can only be one possible value for each\r\npreset. It sounds like the client wants the last dial to behave differently\r\neven though only one value is shown at a time. Not only is this change in\r\nbehavior misleading, I don’t expect a single person using the site to\r\nunderstand it. We can do it, but are there mocks for these “grayed out”\r\nstates?\r\n\r\n2. As for every dial being interactive, what I said before about this being\r\nway more work than our first session still applies. Since some values are\r\nshared by multiple presets, the client will have to be very specific about\r\nwhich preset maps to every shared value. No matter what, this will still be\r\nconfusing to probably everyone since it’s not a one-to-one relationship and\r\nsome presets will never be selected even though they have that value.\r\n\r\n3. Have the links and the design for the bottom button been provided?\r\n\r\nThat’s all for now. Please share your thoughts.\r\n\r\nI don’t have full afternoons anymore and I am currently at capacity, so\r\nwe’ll have to build this out in a few short random sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Feb 11, 2019 at 12:31 PM Kyle Weber <contact@kylewebear.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hey Matt,\r\n>\r\n> Updates from z client after I had my call with him.\r\n>\r\n> Tuner second table(from excel sheet), there are 6 dots on the free\r\n> equipment dial.

This question is geared towards the role We’s design org plays\r\nwhich hopefully would influence and strengthen initiatives like the hiring\r\nstrategy. I haven’t dug into the job portal yet so let me know if you want\r\nme to do something specific and offer my feedback. :)\r\n\r\nQuestion for you: *How important is understanding how we collectively treat\r\npeople as a for-profit company?*\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Jan 22, 2019 at 1:44 PM Salmaan Khan <sal.khan@wework.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hey Matt,\r\n>\r\n> Thanks for your note!

I floated them to Chris and here's what he said:\r\n\r\n1.  One option to consider is reviewing the standard stories app as there are a few static visualizations in there that have not yet been added to the visualization app but have been requested to be moved in there.\r\n\r\n2.  Users have a bit of a hard time finding something relevant for the topic they are coming in looking for such as \"High Cost Claimants\" or \"Opioids\" - it's often many steps to get from their landing page to the topic of interest\r\n\r\n3. Probably the biggest gap here is there is not really a breadcrumb trail that takes them from the home page to the most actionable data\r\n\r\n4. I just realized that our redesign just made it into the demo app this week, so may be better to go look at custom breakdowns (Home --> Explore --> Breakdown --> and see if there is a way to make it more intuitive to create breakdowns for users who are not super familiar with understanding breakdowns;  alternatively, taking a step back to figure out how to \"find\" measures and breakdowns more easily on the preceding screen to select them for an exploration is an observed gap\r\n\r\n5. The users don't really have a strong indicator for \"what action should I take\", so thinking a little about how to give greater priority to more impactful areas is something we have received feedback on.\r\n\r\nI'd also be happy to set up time to provide feedback or \"act as a user\" for him if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like to chat with Chris about anything and I'd be happy to schedule a call with you guys. Please reach out if you have any other questions.\r\nThanks again,\r\nKelly\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Dec 11, 2018 at 3:19 PM Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\nHi Kelly!\r\n\r\nJust saw the invites land in my inbox and I’m in! This demo is rapidly stimulating my curiosity.\r\n\r\nA couple things I noticed as I tried to get in:\r\n\r\n1. The password reset likely sets the user up to fail most of the time by not stating the password requirements clearly before attempting to create a password. All the red warnings made me feel like I was doing it wrong:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. I’m not sure if it was because I was using Safari, but the login page did not automatically take me to the dashboard. I had to manually change the URL:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus the loading experience was very slow on a mediocre 4G connection. It took over 30 seconds to load on my first visit and over 10 seconds to land on my second visit.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can look into those things!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I want to get started on this exercise. One thing I need before I dig deep are a few examples of what the product team has recently learned from customers and users. Ideally, I need at least one behavioral constraint for each of the 5 areas listed previously or I’m just guessing instead of designing. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Perhaps a user has recently requested a recommended visualization for a certain combination of inputs that isn’t currently available or adequate? I probably won’t be able to do much with the Visualize app without an example because I am not familiar with what users are trying to accomplish.\r\n\r\n2. Perhaps a user has voiced confusion when trying find something or a customer has requested a new major feature backed by an unmet need?\r\n\r\n3. Perhaps a user has requested the ability to do something they cannot currently do when creating or editing stories?\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps the team observed multiple users who don’t finish creating a custom measure after they have started and have synthesized a possible reason why?\r\n\r\n5. Perhaps a user has requested clearer suggestions earlier in the experience explaining what they might do to resolve overspending?\r\n\r\nKelly, if you could float those ideas to some folks on the product team to see if they could provide additional input even if it’s “we don’t have an example like that” that would be super helpful! Otherwise, I’ll just take a shot in the dark.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the on-site!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n \r\nOn December 11, 2018 at 1:33:16 PM, Kelly Cameron (kcameron@artemishealth.com) wrote:\r\n\r\n Hey Matt,\r\n\r\n Wonderful!

Chris and Maria would like you to send your progress on the design challenge so far and ask that you don't work on it much between now and your rescheduled interview. We give candidates 7-10 days to work on the challenge so they want to make sure the team sees your work from that time frame, not more.\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions; I'll keep my eye out for your design task progress.\r\nThanks again! I'll reach out soon to reschedule.\r\nKelly\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Dec 19, 2018 at 10:42 AM Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\nSounds great, thank you!

I’ve been referencing the demo site the past couple days as I worked on the design task.\r\n\r\nHouston, we have a problem. I woke up without a voice this morning! I started getting a scratchy throat and cough late yesterday and it probably wouldn’t be best for me to expose the team to that today.\r\n\r\nI’m not sure how many candidates you have in the pipeline or how quickly you want to move, but would it be possible to reschedule this after Jan 3?\r\n\r\nAnother option between now and then could be to present my design task remotely once my voice returns.

I floated them to Chris and here's what he said:\r\n\r\n1.  One option to consider is reviewing the standard stories app as there are a few static visualizations in there that have not yet been added to the visualization app but have been requested to be moved in there.\r\n\r\n2.  Users have a bit of a hard time finding something relevant for the topic they are coming in looking for such as \"High Cost Claimants\" or \"Opioids\" - it's often many steps to get from their landing page to the topic of interest\r\n\r\n3. Probably the biggest gap here is there is not really a breadcrumb trail that takes them from the home page to the most actionable data\r\n\r\n4. I just realized that our redesign just made it into the demo app this week, so may be better to go look at custom breakdowns (Home --> Explore --> Breakdown --> and see if there is a way to make it more intuitive to create breakdowns for users who are not super familiar with understanding breakdowns;  alternatively, taking a step back to figure out how to \"find\" measures and breakdowns more easily on the preceding screen to select them for an exploration is an observed gap\r\n\r\n5. The users don't really have a strong indicator for \"what action should I take\", so thinking a little about how to give greater priority to more impactful areas is something we have received feedback on.\r\n\r\nI'd also be happy to set up time to provide feedback or \"act as a user\" for him if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like to chat with Chris about anything and I'd be happy to schedule a call with you guys. Please reach out if you have any other questions.\r\nThanks again,\r\nKelly\r\n\r\nOn Tue, Dec 11, 2018 at 3:19 PM Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\nHi Kelly!\r\n\r\nJust saw the invites land in my inbox and I’m in! This demo is rapidly stimulating my curiosity.\r\n\r\nA couple things I noticed as I tried to get in:\r\n\r\n1. The password reset likely sets the user up to fail most of the time by not stating the password requirements clearly before attempting to create a password. All the red warnings made me feel like I was doing it wrong:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. I’m not sure if it was because I was using Safari, but the login page did not automatically take me to the dashboard. I had to manually change the URL:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus the loading experience was very slow on a mediocre 4G connection. It took over 30 seconds to load on my first visit and over 10 seconds to land on my second visit.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can look into those things!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I want to get started on this exercise. One thing I need before I dig deep are a few examples of what the product team has recently learned from customers and users. Ideally, I need at least one behavioral constraint for each of the 5 areas listed previously or I’m just guessing instead of designing. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Perhaps a user has recently requested a recommended visualization for a certain combination of inputs that isn’t currently available or adequate? I probably won’t be able to do much with the Visualize app without an example because I am not familiar with what users are trying to accomplish.\r\n\r\n2. Perhaps a user has voiced confusion when trying find something or a customer has requested a new major feature backed by an unmet need?\r\n\r\n3. Perhaps a user has requested the ability to do something they cannot currently do when creating or editing stories?\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps the team observed multiple users who don’t finish creating a custom measure after they have started and have synthesized a possible reason why?\r\n\r\n5. Perhaps a user has requested clearer suggestions earlier in the experience explaining what they might do to resolve overspending?\r\n\r\nKelly, if you could float those ideas to some folks on the product team to see if they could provide additional input even if it’s “we don’t have an example like that” that would be super helpful! Otherwise, I’ll just take a shot in the dark.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the on-site!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n \r\nOn December 11, 2018 at 1:33:16 PM, Kelly Cameron (kcameron@artemishealth.com) wrote:\r\n\r\n Hey Matt,\r\n\r\n Wonderful!

    "body": "Hi Kelly!\r\n\r\nJust saw the invites land in my inbox and I’m in! This demo is rapidly stimulating my curiosity.\r\n\r\nA couple things I noticed as I tried to get in:\r\n\r\n1. The password reset likely sets the user up to fail most of the time by not stating the password requirements clearly before attempting to create a password. All the red warnings made me feel like I was doing it wrong:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. I’m not sure if it was because I was using Safari, but the login page did not automatically take me to the dashboard. I had to manually change the URL:\r\n\r\n\r\nPlus the loading experience was very slow on a mediocre 4G connection. It took over 30 seconds to load on my first visit and over 10 seconds to land on my second visit.\r\n\r\nHopefully someone can look into those things!\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I want to get started on this exercise. One thing I need before I dig deep are a few examples of what the product team has recently learned from customers and users. Ideally, I need at least one behavioral constraint for each of the 5 areas listed previously or I’m just guessing instead of designing. Here are some ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Perhaps a user has recently requested a recommended visualization for a certain combination of inputs that isn’t currently available or adequate? I probably won’t be able to do much with the Visualize app without an example because I am not familiar with what users are trying to accomplish.\r\n\r\n2. Perhaps a user has voiced confusion when trying find something or a customer has requested a new major feature backed by an unmet need?\r\n\r\n3. Perhaps a user has requested the ability to do something they cannot currently do when creating or editing stories?\r\n\r\n4. Perhaps the team observed multiple users who don’t finish creating a custom measure after they have started and have synthesized a possible reason why?\r\n\r\n5. Perhaps a user has requested clearer suggestions earlier in the experience explaining what they might do to resolve overspending?\r\n\r\nKelly, if you could float those ideas to some folks on the product team to see if they could provide additional input even if it’s “we don’t have an example like that” that would be super helpful! Otherwise, I’ll just take a shot in the dark.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the on-site!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n \r\nOn December 11, 2018 at 1:33:16 PM, Kelly Cameron (kcameron@artemishealth.com) wrote:\r\n\r\n Hey Matt,\r\n\r\n Wonderful!

I feel like I’m a person who wants to master what I do before moving on to the next thing. How do I answer the question and let them know I’m comfortable with both directions? Ambiguity.\r\n\r\n* Designer leaving Skullcandy. $100k. Asking too little or asking too much. Utah is funky about talking about money. “I am comfortable taking a step down to $100k if it meant having a better work-life balance.” To recruiter, “Where does your ideal candidate fall, do you have a range?” To hiring manager, “This is what I made in Chicago, but I recognize Utah may be a little different. There’s so much more that goes into my decision than just the salary.” Just try to get more information. Get the story. See what they’re thinking.\r\n\r\n* Pastor as reference. People get nervous when there is a religious person of any kind. You want to protect yourself for all protected categories. Family. Race. Religion. Being a person who shares too much can definitely hurt you. Companies would rather hire someone who doesn’t have kids. Change of scenery?\r\n\r\n* Brainstorming session in-person or mock interview. Shoot times next week. Fridays before 2 are good for Kat. We can spend an hour together.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nLooking forward to our next convo!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2018 at 3:13:41 PM, Kat Campagna (kat@searchgrouppartners.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nStay tuned !

With that said, there is concern that this higher level\r\nproduct thinking would take priority of simply getting the work done, as\r\nsome felt like they did not see a level of craft in interaction and visual\r\ndesign that would be ideal for this position.\r\n\r\nGoing deeper...\r\n\r\nAfter sharing your design exercise with the leadership team (the longer\r\none), and after talking with Autumn, Jeff, and Britney about their\r\nvalidation sessions with you, here are some pieces of positive feedback I\r\nwanted to share:\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *References were great* - We liked what we heard from your references.\r\n   It’s clear that you’ve demonstrated value to the teams you’ve worked with\r\n   in the past, particularly in your abilities as a “unicorn”. Your depth of\r\n   skill in web dev, bridging the gap between what's designed and what ships,\r\n   presents a lot of obvious value, in addition to being a visionary, good\r\n   communicator, and more.\r\n   - *Focus on research and validation* - The whole team thought that you\r\n   had deep and demonstrable skills in conducting research sessions and\r\n   validating your work (shown in your design exercise). This is an area where\r\n   the team at large is less confident and where you could add a lot of value\r\n   to our work and process.\r\n   - *Leading kickoffs and discovery sessions* - Your experience leading\r\n   sprints, kickoffs, research, and validation sessions is also a huge plus,\r\n   as that is one of the core responsibilities of this role. You have good\r\n   soft skills and can \"run a room\". This is big as we need someone else on\r\n   the team to do this.\r\n   - *Developing product strategy* - It’s clear you care a lot about\r\n   digging into the “why” of a project, mapping things to a vision and\r\n   strategy, making sure that there is significant discovery done and that\r\n   everything maps back to solving a problem. This is critical.\r\n   - *Focus on growth* - You clearly care about learning and improving your\r\n   craft, utilizing the best processes, methods, and tools, this is an example\r\n   that we’d like to see set for the rest of the team.\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *Ability to mentor* - You have experience in mentorship and like to\r\n   work well with others. Core for this role.\r\n   - *Culture fit* - People thought you were a cool dude and would fit in\r\n   well… obviously important.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd some potential concerns (or opportunities for growth):\r\n\r\n\r\n   - *Potential lack of strong craft *- Specifically craft in visual\r\n   design, with some potential concern with interaction design. Part of this\r\n   is likely due to you not having enough time to put together polished\r\n   deliverables for the design exercise, but some thought they didn’t see the\r\n   chops they’d expect at this level in other work you’ve shared.\r\n      - *Follow up:* There are a couple ways we could solve this in the\r\n      short term. First would be for you to share some high fidelity visual and\r\n      interactive design work that goes into more detail than what’s shared on\r\n      your site. Things that show focus on composition and typography (in UI\r\n      specifically). Bonus points for sharing any motion prototypes that you’ve\r\n      created. Another option here would be to pay you for spending a bit more\r\n      time on the design exercise, focusing on the UI. Your call.\r\n   - *Focus on theory/interests over work* - This is kind of implied in\r\n   other things I’ve said, but there is concern that you may talk more about\r\n   the ideal case, best practices, or philosophical theories of design rather\r\n   than simply getting things done and making a quick impact. *Or* be too\r\n   connected to what you feel is best to be objective on best next steps.\r\n   Frankly, part of this may be the nature of the interview process, but\r\n   overall our team seeks to prioritize work over theory/ideals, which is why\r\n   there is *some* concern here.\r\n      - *Follow up:* Some of this would have to come later as we have you\r\n      work on your own client projects and provide direction on 1-2\r\nothers to see\r\n      how things unfold.\r\n   - *Lack of brevity* - Coming from the team and from references, there is\r\n   concern about brevity in speech – prioritizing talk over action, and\r\n   generally being \"long-winded\" when it may not be necessary. I’m not\r\n   *totally* concerned about this, as over communication is better than\r\n   little communication, but it is worth mentioning.\r\n      - *Follow up:* This may just be a mindfulness thing, and am less\r\n      concerned with this as communication is going to be core to the\r\nsuccess of\r\n      the role.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully these things don’t come as a surprise and you’re grateful to get\r\nthe feedback. The follow up items I listed above are meant to be some next\r\nsteps we could take to build more confidence in those areas and ease\r\nconcerns, specifically the feedback on craft.\r\n\r\nAt this point, my gut tells me that you’d be a great fit for the team and\r\nI’d like to bring you on. That said, if we can help quell some concerns\r\nfrom the team—at least in the first area—I know that the rest of the team\r\nwould be 100% on board.\r\n\r\nLet me know what thoughts or questions you have with that. Would be happy\r\nto discuss more in person!\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n*Adam Tolman*\r\nDesign Director <http://www.underbelly.co/>\r\n*underbelly.is <http://www.underbelly.is/>*\r\nC 801.599.5709\r\n"

I’ve appreciated getting to know you more, tell you more about Underbelly, and learn about your skills and experience. You’ve been great through this whole process.\r\n\r\nSo... with all that said, we’ve decided to change our strategy on this lead designer position, focusing less on bringing in an outside hire and instead growing some internal folks on the team more intentionally – elevating them to more senior positions where they are responsible to give feedback, critique, and direction on other designers work in addition to doing work of their own. I still see a lot of value in bringing someone onboard that can shore up the teams weaknesses in product strategy, vision, dev, and helping lead discovery and research, but we may revisit that sometime in H1 2019.\r\n\r\nThere are a few reasons why this was our decision, but ultimately I feel like this is the right one, just considering the timing with our agency, clients, and projects, and what things are currently queued up for next year. Perhaps when this need resurfaces we can chat about fit.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I would love to continue to keep in touch, grab lunch, and jam on design, community, product, and church. It’d be good to keep in touch!\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for your interest, working with us throughout this process, participating in everything, and being so open to discuss strengths and opportunities for improvement.\r\n\r\nHappy to answer any specific questions you have!\r\n\r\nTalk soon.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nAdam Tolman\r\nDesign Director\r\nunderbelly.is     C 801.599.5709\r\n\r\n"

I rushed my portfolio together to get on the scene and start having conversations, but it’s clear I need to do a better job presenting my 6 years of product experience. The hiring team at Instructure loved the Underbelly presentation which is why I decided to anchor on it, but I’ll need to dig deeper for a senior+ product role.\r\n\r\nWho knows what the future holds?\r\n\r\nSee you around and thanks again!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn November 14, 2018 at 11:32:18 AM, Amie Millar (amillar@lucidchart.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nHey Matt - I was able to gather some feedback and wanted to share it with you. The response from the team on why we didn't move forward was because they were looking forward to reviewing some of your past work and experience. They didn't feel your experience and potential was uncovered in the Underbelly Design Challenge during the portfolio review. That project didn’t give them enough context to evaluate your skills and experience appropriately (assumptions, research, iterations, delivery, measuring success, etc). It's unfortunate you didn't have access to some of your past work, because it sounds there is a lot of rich context and experience there.\r\n\r\nBased on this experience and what our current needs are, this wasn't the right fit for us at this time. I know the team feels you are talented and enjoyed getting to know you better. As we continue to grow, we encourage you to keep in touch and let us know if you are interested in other opportunities in the future.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn 9:54pm, Mon 11/12/18, me@mattborn.com wrote:\r\nSounds great, thank you!\r\n\r\nOn Mon, Nov 12, 2018 at 9:51 PM Amie Millar <amillar@lucidchart.com> wrote:\r\nYou bet.

It was great meeting you in person.\r\n\r\nWe recognize & appreciate the time you devoted to learning more about joining our team.

    "body": "Adam, you are so awesome! Thank you for taking the time to write this!\r\n\r\nTruly I say to you, these things don’t come as a surprise and I am extremely grateful for this feedback. Especially since it’s coming from people who need to know this at the start.\r\n\r\nOn the first point, I know I am not the strongest visual or interaction designer and I never intend to be. But like I said to Wade Shearer on the first day of my job hunt, I’d love to prove you wrong and impress you. Give me a day to dig up some past interactive examples. In the meantime, here is something I just whipped up in an hour today for Clayton & JJ over at Bluehost because they said their site still feels like it’s 2004: https://ws4.sinaimg.cn/large/006tNbRwly1fx09haemgpj31kw4261l4.jpg\r\n\r\nOn the other 2 points, I’ll just say this is something I’ve always struggled with, but I’ve received feedback from everyone I’ve managed and worked with the past year that I am steadily and noticeably improving. My goal is to find someone to help me maintain a podcast because it’s something I haven’t tried yet to see if having a reliable outlet for my theories would make it easier for me to compartmentalize that side of my creativity.\r\n\r\nRemember that Originals book I was telling you about? Check out some of these pull quotes:\r\n“On matters of style, swim with the current,” Thomas Jefferson allegedly advised, but “on matters of principle, stand like a rock.” The pressure to achieve leads us to do the opposite.\r\nHaving a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another.\r\n“The best entrepreneurs are not risk maximizers. … They take the risk out of risk-taking.”\r\nThe biggest barrier to originality is not idea generation; it’s idea selection.\r\nI believe my passionate verbal dissent comes from my background of working with people who don’t understand why validation is important. Based on the first part of your email and my experiences with everyone at Underbelly so far, it seems like I won’t have to worry about this as much. The people who have worked with me most understand I thrive under constraint including deadlines and definition of done which is frankly something the product world really struggles with.\r\n\r\nI want to swim with Underbelly’s current. I want to learn from ya’ll. I want to help our clients and our team mitigate risk. I want to practice insane focus and listening.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more work samples.\r\n\r\nDeeply grateful,\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn November 7, 2018 at 4:29:41 PM, Adam Tolman (adam@underbelly.is) wrote:\r\n\r\nHey Matt, \r\n\r\nThanks again for your patience in hearing back from Underbelly. I’m grateful you’re not in a hurry :) This is going to be a longer email as I wanted to share all feedback as I thought that would be beneficial for you.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - The team and I like you, think you’d fit in well, and think your deep product strategy, vision, research, validation, and development expertise would help bolster the teams confidence in those areas – which would be valuable. With that said, there is concern that this higher level product thinking would take priority of simply getting the work done, as some felt like they did not see a level of craft in interaction and visual design that would be ideal for this position.\r\n\r\nGoing deeper...\r\n\r\nAfter sharing your design exercise with the leadership team (the longer one), and after talking with Autumn, Jeff, and Britney about their validation sessions with you, here are some pieces of positive feedback I wanted to share:\r\n\r\nReferences were great - We liked what we heard from your references. It’s clear that you’ve demonstrated value to the teams you’ve worked with in the past, particularly in your abilities as a “unicorn”. Your depth of skill in web dev, bridging the gap between what's designed and what ships, presents a lot of obvious value, in addition to being a visionary, good communicator, and more.\r\nFocus on research and validation - The whole team thought that you had deep and demonstrable skills in conducting research sessions and validating your work (shown in your design exercise). This is an area where the team at large is less confident and where you could add a lot of value to our work and process.\r\nLeading kickoffs and discovery sessions - Your experience leading sprints, kickoffs, research, and validation sessions is also a huge plus, as that is one of the core responsibilities of this role. You have good soft skills and can \"run a room\". This is big as we need someone else on the team to do this.\r\nDeveloping product strategy - It’s clear you care a lot about digging into the “why” of a project, mapping things to a vision and strategy, making sure that there is significant discovery done and that everything maps back to solving a problem. This is critical.\r\nFocus on growth - You clearly care about learning and improving your craft, utilizing the best processes, methods, and tools, this is an example that we’d like to see set for the rest of the team.\r\nAbility to mentor - You have experience in mentorship and like to work well with others. Core for this role.\r\nCulture fit - People thought you were a cool dude and would fit in well… obviously important.\r\n\r\nAnd some potential concerns (or opportunities for growth):\r\n\r\nPotential lack of strong craft - Specifically craft in visual design, with some potential concern with interaction design. Part of this is likely due to you not having enough time to put together polished deliverables for the design exercise, but some thought they didn’t see the chops they’d expect at this level in other work you’ve shared.\r\nFollow up: There are a couple ways we could solve this in the short term. First would be for you to share some high fidelity visual and interactive design work that goes into more detail than what’s shared on your site. Things that show focus on composition and typography (in UI specifically). Bonus points for sharing any motion prototypes that you’ve created. Another option here would be to pay you for spending a bit more time on the design exercise, focusing on the UI. Your call.\r\nFocus on theory/interests over work - This is kind of implied in other things I’ve said, but there is concern that you may talk more about the ideal case, best practices, or philosophical theories of design rather than simply getting things done and making a quick impact. Or be too connected to what you feel is best to be objective on best next steps. Frankly, part of this may be the nature of the interview process, but overall our team seeks to prioritize work over theory/ideals, which is why there is some concern here.\r\nFollow up: Some of this would have to come later as we have you work on your own client projects and provide direction on 1-2 others to see how things unfold.\r\nLack of brevity - Coming from the team and from references, there is concern about brevity in speech – prioritizing talk over action, and generally being \"long-winded\" when it may not be necessary. I’m not totally concerned about this, as over communication is better than little communication, but it is worth mentioning.\r\nFollow up: This may just be a mindfulness thing, and am less concerned with this as communication is going to be core to the success of the role.\r\n\r\nHopefully these things don’t come as a surprise and you’re grateful to get the feedback. The follow up items I listed above are meant to be some next steps we could take to build more confidence in those areas and ease concerns, specifically the feedback on craft. \r\n\r\nAt this point, my gut tells me that you’d be a great fit for the team and I’d like to bring you on. That said, if we can help quell some concerns from the team—at least in the first area—I know that the rest of the team would be 100% on board. \r\n\r\nLet me know what thoughts or questions you have with that. Would be happy to discuss more in person!\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nAdam Tolman\r\nDesign Director\r\nunderbelly.is C 801.599.5709\r\n\r\n"

But the amount of time I work on anything not related to the product, customers, or user experience is pretty minimal, peppered throughout these percentages. I guess I consider things like interpersonal issues, team building, and process tweaks “internal\", but you could argue the results of that work is for the customer, so it depends on where you draw the line on diminishing returns.\r\n\r\n👍🏻 Happy to answer anything else!\r\n\r\nOn Oct 31, 2018, at 11:21 PM, Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\n\r\nThis is great, thanks so much!

These are tough questions! haha\r\n\r\n1. How much of your time is spent solving external problems?\r\n\r\nDepends on what you mean by external. Problems that show up that aren’t a part of what I would consider “my job\" are super rare, if that’s what you mean, but you may not and what we each consider external probably differs. There’s still gobs of organizational, process, and interpersonal problems to solve, tho. Will you provide an example or clarify a bit?\r\n\r\n2. Can you think of a time when a peer was rewarded for dissent over conformity?\r\n\r\nYeah, for sure! (if you mean dissent in a positive way, such as reasonable objections and trailblazing, rather than obtuse resistance without constructive purpose) This is an actual measurement of success at Instructure. We value individual thinking, folks who push the envelope, and regular innovation. I push the norms every day. I disagree with clear reasoning in just about every structured and organic meeting I’m a part of. There are places where conformity matters, such as consistency in the product experience and within familiar conventions, but the culture here is to make stuff better in every way throughout every day, and you can’t do that if you acquiesce. A good example is recently we gave a PM some room to spread his wings with research in a way that was pretty out of the ordinary, and the reaction has been really strong. My PM and I did similar radical research and it ended by making a Career product instead of the Succession Planning product we were charged with at the time, and I feel like it’s worked out really well for us. We create safe environments for this culture to exist. Take a close look at our Bridge product and you’ll see innovations everywhere (happy to walk you through some of it). There isn’t just one smart person calling all the shots here. We only hire super talented, intelligent, and passionate people. Lots of strong opinions that are well-stated but loosely held and eventual consensus make better products. :)\r\n\r\n3. Can you describe a team leader besides Devin who rewards process over luck?\r\n\r\nDo you mean similarly to a teacher rewarding students for solving math equations when showing work rather than guessing the answer? As in a designer being rewarded for lots of research, exploration, synthesis, ideation, and confidence before delivery? Or an product manager being rewarded for understanding the tough problems really well through lots of communication and empathy, rather than guessing? Too bad this isn’t as straightforward as math, haha. There’s always an important luck factor in everything we do (that or providence, depending on what you believe). I think we’re all guessing to varying degrees. It’s also difficult to track what comes from process and what comes from luck. We as humans have so many innate biases that even the most aware researchers conclude imperfections in synthesis and conclusions. That said, employees who go all out to solve problems are usually the most valued. But if you mean the kind of process that PgMs use to keep everyone on track, I think we use just enough, and only PgMs are rewarded for that kind of process. There’s definitely folks, including myself, that kick against arbitrary deadlines and padded estimates, but regular checkins and realistic roadmaps are critical to delivery. On the flip-side, I can’t think of a single person or team that’s been rewarded for being lucky. Hope this answers your question. Didn’t want to punt like I did on your first question, haha\r\n\r\nThanks Matt!

Thanks for asking. In general, I’ve found that personal relationships that start with respect and end with empathy and vulnerability sow seeds that grow into trust, and trust is foundational to influence. So I work a lot on this. For designers specifically, succinct and thoughtful decision-, fact-, and opinion-articulation and collaboration with graceful concession is critical. For engineers, intimately understanding the medium (as you mentioned) and respecting limitations, laced with humor works well. For non-product folks, simply listening for concerns and sharing ownership in the problems they face does wonders.\r\n\r\nI have this trust-based relationship with my manager, Devin. He’s really good at listening to and considering the changes I suggest. Usually, he’s taken those suggestions and multiplied them in new ways that end up better than I imagined. But honestly, we each have enough autonomy that managing up is rarely needed. I’ve never had a VP+ stop me from solving problems. It’s one of the special things about Instructure. My hunch is that if you were to work here, you’d feel very fulfilled with the potential for impact.\r\n\r\nWe’ve recently had some changes at the product VP level, so it’ll be interesting to see how to work with them specifically, but in the past, what I mentioned above has worked well. I’ve had plenty of face-time with the CEO and VPs working on this new Career project and everyone is accessible by culture, but like anywhere, there’s a good measure of the executive-presence skill needed for sure.\r\n\r\nHope that answers your question.

    "body": "Jesh, thank you for an equally thoughtful answer!\r\n\r\nThis is so positive and it speaks volumes how you champion Instructure’s culture. That said, I don’t want to work where there aren’t massive problems to solve. 😉 Three more questions if you have the time:\r\n\r\n1. How much of your time is spent solving external problems?\r\n2. Can you think of a time when a peer was rewarded for dissent over conformity?\r\n3. Can you describe a team leader besides Devin who rewards process over luck?\r\n\r\nThanks again for letting me grill you!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n🙌 trust is foundational to influence\r\n\r\nOn October 29, 2018 at 10:20:12 AM, Jesh Barlow (jbarlow@instructure.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nYou bet!\r\n\r\nThis is a super thoughtful question. Thanks for asking. In general, I’ve found that personal relationships that start with respect and end with empathy and vulnerability sow seeds that grow into trust, and trust is foundational to influence. So I work a lot on this. For designers specifically, succinct and thoughtful decision-, fact-, and opinion-articulation and collaboration with graceful concession is critical. For engineers, intimately understanding the medium (as you mentioned) and respecting limitations, laced with humor works well. For non-product folks, simply listening for concerns and sharing ownership in the problems they face does wonders.\r\n\r\nI have this trust-based relationship with my manager, Devin. He’s really good at listening to and considering the changes I suggest. Usually, he’s taken those suggestions and multiplied them in new ways that end up better than I imagined. But honestly, we each have enough autonomy that managing up is rarely needed. I’ve never had a VP+ stop me from solving problems. It’s one of the special things about Instructure. My hunch is that if you were to work here, you’d feel very fulfilled with the potential for impact.\r\n\r\nWe’ve recently had some changes at the product VP level, so it’ll be interesting to see how to work with them specifically, but in the past, what I mentioned above has worked well. I’ve had plenty of face-time with the CEO and VPs working on this new Career project and everyone is accessible by culture, but like anywhere, there’s a good measure of the executive-presence skill needed for sure.\r\n\r\nHope that answers your question. I’m happy to answer more!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n- Jesh\r\n\r\nOn Oct 26, 2018, at 5:28 PM, Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\n\r\nYou too, Jesh! Had a blast meeting ya’ll. I really appreciate this follow up.\r\n\r\nI’m curious about your personal experience exercising influence at all levels—your fellow designers, engineers, and non-product folks, laterally to more senior folks in those disciplines, and “managing up” to your manager or other VP+ folks. What has worked well for you so far and where have you met the most resistance?\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn October 26, 2018 at 12:22:41 PM, Jesh Barlow (jbarlow@instructure.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nHey Matt, \r\n\r\nThanks so much for coming in today and taking the time.

The way you’re breaking this down demonstrates a great deal of your process and thinking already, and that’s totally the point.\r\n\r\nAlso, I saw that you may elect to use UX Power Tools for the UI/visual design, which makes a ton of sense for moving more quickly to validate the product (again, thinking of the real world). With that said, I would encourage you to put some more time into the UI/visual design, potentially using that as a means of solving the problem in a way that may differentiate the product. Unique, polished visual design goes along way here, especially once we’ve seen deep product/design thinking.\r\n\r\nAnyway, hopefully that helps, but I’m more than happy to answer any other questions.\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time, man!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nAdam Tolman\r\nDesign Director\r\nunderbelly.is C 801.599.5709\r\n\r\nOn Oct 19, 2018, at 1:48 PM, Matt Born <me@mattborn.com> wrote:\r\n\r\nAdam,\r\n\r\nMy goal today is to craft a schedule to work on this next week starting Monday, but I read through the PDF and spent an hour capturing my initial brain dump: \r\n\r\n<roadtrip-initial-thoughts.png>\r\n\r\nSome questions:\r\n\r\n* Should I treat this exercise as a hypothetical of someone with deep pockets funding a hunch-based moonshot and ignore real world business constraints related to budget, resources, timeline, orchestration, etc.?\r\n* Are there any restrictions on making my work public or involving others—including strangers?\r\n* If I set up 2 non-negotiable validation tests or mock client/stakeholder reviews next week, would that be something I could get a couple Underbelly folks to spare 45 mins of their time or should I do something like that with my own people?\r\n* Friend zone moment: Am I on the right track or do you have any tips to help me shrink the universe?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help in advance!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n"

I am currently still unemployed if you need anything right now. :)\r\n\r\nHow are things going since you sent this email?\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Aug 29, 2018 at 12:46 PM Celeste Cecchi <celeste.n.cecchi@gmail.com> wrote:\r\nOH! And I should probably give you a brief synopsis of the project. I'll copy and paste the initial *informal* proposal I wrote for my academic advisor below (it's easier that way since it was formatted for my school site). \r\n\r\nMatt, I'm not sure how much Eric has shared about my program, but I've been studying social justice with an emphasis in biblical advocacy. (Just though knowing that might help explain the wording/direction I took my proposal.)\r\n\r\n.....\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn his book Pursuing Justice, Ken Wytsma describes how sin and\r\ninjustice have torn the fabric of shalom—or the intended wholeness\r\nand flourishing of God’s creation. Wytsma quotes Cornelius\r\nPlantinga, saying, “To be a responsible [Christian] is to find\r\none’s role in the building of shalom, the re-webbing of God,\r\nhumanity, and all creation in justice, harmony, fulfillment, and\r\ndelight.”(16)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDesiring to be a responsible [Christian] and therefore find my role\r\nin the rebuilding of shalom, and believing that sin has indeed\r\nbroken said shalom, I am proposing the undertaking of The Belong\r\nMarketplace as my thesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Belong Marketplace will be a tool (specifically an\r\napplication) for individuals who desire to actively pursue the\r\nrebuilding of shalom through social justice. This app will connect\r\nits users with resources, churches, and organizations currently\r\nfighting to restore brokenness in their communities. The\r\norganizations will also benefit from the app, being connected with\r\npotential volunteers, supporters, and visibility within their\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goals of my thesis are:\r\n\r\n\r\nTo develop a user-friendly app which compels its users to engage in\r\nsocial justice by connecting them with local\r\norganizations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo move its users from awareness to action to advocacy by using the\r\nframework of Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs (which\r\nculminates in human flourishing)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately though, the goal of my thesis is to restore shalom. As\r\nWytsma points out, “Without justice there can be no shalom. Shalom\r\nflourishes in the presence of justice. Biblical shalom requires the\r\nactive pursuit of what ought to be... [God] wants to undo\r\nthe effects of sin and bring about shalom—isn’t that why He sent\r\nJesus?”(27)  \r\nIf God’s ultimate goal in sending Jesus was to restore shalom,\r\nshouldn’t our goal be to join Him in this work?\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Aug 29, 2018 at 1:28 PM Celeste Cecchi <celeste.n.cecchi@gmail.com> wrote:\r\nHello lover, sister, and friend! \r\n(I'll let each of you figure out which of those belongs to you.😉)\r\n\r\nThough I suppose this update is primarily for the sake of Matt since I talk to the other two regularly, I thought I'd gather the original Belong sprint team together in this long-overdue update. Obviously you all have stake in this project, having invested time, energy and more, so I thought it was only fair I share a few things with you.\r\n\r\nAs you know, Belong has been on a sabbatical of sorts for the past couple years. After the second sprint somewhat derailed the vision, I wound up frustrated and in grad school (not a bad alternative). I'm nearing the end of my program now—like, I'm graduating in a few weeks! However, I still have to complete and defend my thesis before I'll officially be given that *most-expensive-piece-of-paper-we-all-have-stuffed-in-a-drawer-somewhere*. And said thesis is the purpose of this email.\r\n\r\nSo Belong and I may have been on a break for a while, but I couldn't shake it from my heart. There was still something there I felt God wasn't finished with yet. Because of this, I decided to mention it to my academic advisor (half joking) as a potential thesis. I was less than confident that this anything-but-conventional thesis would be approved by her, let alone by the board—and then it was. It was more than approved. It was supported, passed along to higher ups, and then backed in ways I couldn't have imagined it would be. (Read: potential financial backing?!) \r\n\r\nAnyway, long short of it is that Belong is being resuscitated. And that (perhaps combined with nostalgia) compelled me to reach out. \r\n\r\nFirstly, I wanted to thank you ALL for believing in Belong enough to get on board and make a personal investment in it years ago. Honestly, that first sprint is the thing I go back to for vitality on a regular basis. Secondly, I wanted to ask if you're all comfortable with me moving forward with this as my thesis project, knowing it will likely change the dynamics and/or direction we were headed in together at one time. (Again, you are all stakeholders of sorts, so I don't want to claim this as \"mine\".) Lastly, I am wondering whether or not you would be interested in being an advisor/consultant for the project. I know you're all in different seasons of life and are crazy busy now. The time commitment could be whatever you choose for it to be. Agreeing to being an advisor would basically just mean I list you in my thesis portfolio as a part of my advisory board (this process all sounds so official and grown up hahah!). Beyond that, though, it's up to you how much or how little you want to be involved. For example, I could just bounce ideas off you once in a while, or you could all quit your jobs, move to Chicago, and commit to working on my thesis with me full time from now until December when I have to defend it before the school board.😉\r\n\r\nAgain, I appreciate the investment you've already made in Belong—you brought it to life! Can’t wait to fill you in about where God takes it from here!😊 \r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It’s a platform for improving the way people collaborate remotely.\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 2018 at 9:56:27 AM, Spoke Beta (spoke.beta@gmail.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Matt,\r\n\r\nIt was great talking to you and thank you so much for your interest in participating in the Spoke private pilot!\r\n\r\nThe goal of this pilot is to get feedback about what you do and don't like about Spoke and to learn about how you use it. We're also so excited to offer you early access to a new product designed for remote/distributed teams.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick rundown of what to expect:\r\nPilot testing begins on October 22nd and will last 2 weeks (with the option to extend)\r\nOn October 22nd, I'll send you a download link to the Spoke app along with sign up instructions. The app works on iOS only.\r\nPart of the sign up process will include creating a Team Code. After you've created a Team Code, you'll send it to your teammates so that they can join Spoke with you. Make sure that they don't create their own code, otherwise they'll be on a different team!\r\nPlease give your teammates a heads up about the pilot this week so they're ready to go when it begins!\r\n\r\nFAQ's\r\n\r\nWho on my team should I invite to join me?\r\nSpoke works well with people who you need catch up with during the day. These are usually people on your immediate team or who you often work on projects with. Feel free to send out your team code to as many people as you'd like.\r\n\r\nWhen should I use Spoke?\r\nHop onto Spoke to indicate you're free to talk. Others on your team will get a notification that you've entered the app. If someone on your team needs to run something by you, wants to talk through some ideas or just say hello, they'll hop on too. The same works for your teammates too.\r\n\r\nAre my conversations private?\r\nYes, completely. Your conversations can only be heard by individuals in the app with you. We will collect some general metrics on usage (like hours on the platform). What you say is completely private.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I am obligated to do as a tester?\r\nSend us feedback as often as possible! You and your teammates can email spoke.beta@gmail.com or text me at 925.768.4307 whenever anything comes to mind. The more feedback, the better. I'll be checking in occasionally to see how things are going, as well.\r\n\r\n///\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions. Can't wait to get started!\r\nAdena\r\n"

I found it very\r\nencouraging to learn there are leaders like you who champion the\r\ndisciplines I’ve fought for in the past. Ended up chatting with Blake for\r\nan hour in the lobby and was really inspired by his story and vision as\r\nwell. Here are 3 things that stood out to me (or my interpretation anyway):\r\n\r\n1. As design leaders, we replicate user research into every customer-facing\r\npeer. e.g. Understanding your customer’s problem—not their request—makes\r\nyou a better salesperson.\r\n2. Nearly all of our customers said they would buy another product from us,\r\nso we are launching several new products the next couple quarters. It *is*\r\ncrazy.\r\n3. 👻 We’re excited about design systems, scaling research, and doubling\r\ndown on deep prototypes to drive new products—both externally and\r\ninternally.\r\n\r\nRight now, I want to be hands-on because I haven’t had enough success\r\nbringing novel ideas to market. I also want to find a team who appreciates\r\na very technical approach to design à la Airbnb. My goal is to work my way\r\nto staff in 1–2 years, principal in 3–4 years, and mentor a dozen more\r\ndesigners. In 5 years, I want to be qualified for this role (\r\nhttps://stripe.com/jobs/positions/head-of-product-design) and I know folks\r\nlike you and Blake would help me get there.\r\n\r\nSome inspiration I mentioned during our conversation:\r\n* Kevin Hale’s talk about every person talking to customers 2 hours per\r\nweek including engineers AKA Support Driven Development:\r\nhttps://youtu.be/sz_LgBAGYyo?t=15m20s\r\n* Tom Chi (dunno why I called him Mike) on Staying in the Medium:\r\nhttps://www.mindtheproduct.com/2015/07/video-tom-chi-on-rapid-prototyping-product-management/\r\n* Design leadership + management links I maintain with Mig Reyes (didn’t\r\nmention this, but thought I’d share anyways): http://mgmt.design\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time and encouragement! Looking forward to following\r\nup with Blake again soon.\r\n\r\nWith massive gratitude,\r\nMatt\r\n"

A lot of what you said was inspiring which tends to\r\nmake me ramble with new ideas. I’ve preferred small companies so I wasn’t\r\nsure where I landed on a company like Facebook, but you reshaped my\r\nopinion. I wrote this the day after we talked:\r\n\r\n> Life is about connecting with people. Facebook is building these\r\nconnections. They are probably the best in the world at this. They have the\r\nmeans to connect almost every living human, and they are investing the\r\nresources to get there. I could be on a team that focuses on this growth\r\nand operates like a small start-up. It’s not primarily about conversion and\r\nrevenue; it’s about connection for global equity. Mark is willing to spend\r\nbillions to achieve this.\r\n\r\nThank you for your candid responses to my questions! As a reminder, I am\r\nholding you to this statement: *“I’ve never seen anyone put the business\r\nbefore our users.”* I hope this is true for other companies I am talking to\r\nhere in the Salt Lake Valley, and I hope to have the sort of influence that\r\ninspires people to speak as highly as you do about the brand you represent.\r\n\r\nA move to Menlo would be tough in this season of life, but we will\r\nentertain this as we plan for our next chapter. You mentioned a call with\r\nsomeone one the business side. Is that something we could still do now so I\r\ncould learn a little more?\r\n\r\nAppreciate all your help!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n"

After months of prayer, building\r\nrelationship and spreading the word on social media, we had our first\r\nVision + Worship Night at The Art Factory.\r\n\r\nThis event started as an experiment. The idea was, rather than simply tell\r\npeople about Ridgeline, we wanted to invite them to experience it first\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nOur team lead worship and I preached a message from Romans 10:1-15 called\r\n“Losing the Ladder, Receiving the Gift.” We dismantled religion as a means\r\nto climb our way into right relationship with God and instead invited\r\npeople to simply receive the gift of grace held out to us by Jesus. We\r\nfinished the night off with some text message Q&A, which is always a good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe “experiment” was a success! We had just over 60 adults, a bunch of kids\r\nand a number of people signing up for more information about Ridgeline.\r\n\r\nCOMING UP:\r\nSunday marks the kickoff of our Launch Team Worship Services. We’ll have\r\nchildcare for infants - kindergarten, acoustic worship, teaching and Q&A.\r\n\r\nWe’re spending the next five months building up and into our launch team\r\nwith a teaching series called “This Is Ridgeline.” We’ll cover some core\r\ndoctrinal and practical convictions, as well as doing a deep dive into the\r\ncultural characteristics we want to mark our new church.\r\n\r\nOur prayer is to see our team grow to 100 people as we build toward our\r\npublic launch in early September.\r\n\r\nHelp us spread the word! If you’re here in Salt Lake, invite someone to\r\njoin you this Sunday at 10a. Call, text, or email a few people, insure them\r\nwe’re not psychos and invite them to come check it out, no strings\r\nattached. You can also share our invite video on your Facebook page\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RidgelineSLC/videos/10155534643272896/?notif_id=1522077661456104¬if_t=page_post_reaction\r\n<https://www.facebook.com/RidgelineSLC/videos/10155534643272896/?notif_id=1522077661456104&notif_t=page_post_reaction>.  \r\nWe\r\nwant the entire Salt Lake Valley to know that Jesus loves them and we do\r\nto.\r\n\r\nLAUNCH TEAM SPOTLIGHT:\r\nThe newest people courageous enough to move across the country and join our\r\nteam are Matt and DeeDee Johnson. I just had the privilege of performing\r\ntheir wedding last month and as payment they moved to Salt Lake City to\r\njoin our church (j/k they were already coming).\r\n\r\nMatt is currently working in IT and Deedee is pursuing a job in mental\r\nhealth social work. Matt serves as one of our worship leaders and Deedee\r\nhelps with sound and media. The thing they’re most excited about at\r\nRidgeline is being a part of building a healthy church culture with great\r\nfriends in an area with an immense amount of need.\r\n\r\nWe’re blessed to have this great couple and excited for how God will use\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou can join our team and be a part of all God’s doing in and through\r\nRidgeline too. Fill out this short form and we’ll get you connected.\r\nhttps://ridgeline.formstack.com/forms/info_card\r\n\r\nSHARING THE LOAD:\r\nSaturday a handful of people on our team all pitched in to do some more\r\nwork at The Art Factory. We painted, cleaned and even built some IKEA\r\nfurniture without anyone quitting our church (if building IKEA furniture\r\nwith a good attitude isn’t a sign of revival, I don’t know what is.\r\nRidgeline is Jesus’ church and He’s building it through great people like\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in sharing the load at Ridgeline in some way, click\r\nhere to find the full list of our missional teams to serve on.\r\n\r\nLINKS TO STUFF I LOVE:\r\nRead\r\n\r\n    - Garden City by John Mark Comer -\r\n     \r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Garden-City-Work-Being-Human/dp/0310337348/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1522178145&sr=8-1&keywords=garden+city+john+mark+comer&dpID=317XJ8x6OML&preST=_SY291_BO1\r\n    ,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch\r\n    - Kingdom Conspiracy by Scot McKnight -\r\n     \r\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Conspiracy-Returning-Radical-Mission/dp/0801097851/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1522178187&sr=1-1&keywords=kingdom+conspiracy&dpID=51OOKwGwl2L&preST=_SY291_BO1\r\n    ,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch\r\n\r\n\r\nListen\r\n\r\n    - Whole Heart by Passion -\r\n     \r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/122324635/playlist/2p9plvGxydk9NMPxK1wbAO?si=ttLg805HSE2KVZKtz4H2Xg\r\n    - Good News by Rend Collective -\r\n     \r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/user/122324635/playlist/4dLR5uFbPa2d86fyizl0kj?si=qk54dMLxSDCKOV_umc3C5g\r\n    - Hallelujah Amen by Vertical Worship -\r\n     \r\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/78wyAJJM6TsN428S5ScPg7?si=AVgAfz1ARWSFgCD35kM8wg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Ryan Huguley*\r\nTwitter <https://twitter.com/ryanhuguley> | Facebook\r\n<https://www.facebook.com/Ryanhuguley> | Instagram\r\n<https://www.instagram.com/ryanhuguley/> | Blog <http://ryanhuguley.com/>\r\n\r\nSent from my iPad\r\n"

I\r\ndid not see Powerfront in the list.\r\n\r\n2. Well done on Dribbble! Already over 500 views and several comments. Keep\r\ngoing and read this if you haven’t already:\r\nhttps://blog.intercom.com/the-dribbblisation-of-design/\r\n\r\n3. Please share the link to the site that is like Codewars.\r\n\r\n4. WordPress is 3 very different things: configuration, content management,\r\nand advanced capabilities. While it is helpful to be familiar with\r\nWordPress, almost every organization doesn’t actually need any of these\r\nthings specifically from WordPress and most only really need help with\r\ncontent management even though they think they need more. We can chat more\r\nabout this and I’ll try to help you filter out the noise.\r\n\r\n5. Last big conference I went to was Google I/O last year. I try to avoid\r\ndesign conferences because they sort of all turn into the same thing after\r\nawhile. I attend, host, and speak at smaller events on a regular basis, but\r\nthat’s a lot easier to do in Chicago like we discussed before. Some of my\r\ncoworkers highly recommend valiocon.com, aneventapart.com, smashingconf.com,\r\nand howdesignlive.com. Avoid any conferences that don’t have any\r\nrecognizable speakers because they are just trying to make money.\r\nDefinitely go to Dragoncon again this year, but treat it as an opportunity\r\nto build your network and ask around about marketing needs. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful update! I’ll text you to see if you can still do\r\na call today.\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Apr 20, 2017 at 7:15 PM, Erin Johnson <erinjohnson21@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> So I had an interview Tuesday for a remote graphic design job.

Since they already know you intend to\r\ncontinue working with them, I’m surprised they aren’t suggesting a more\r\niterative, conversion-driven approach that is lower fidelity and\r\nfaster-to-market.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to go with “accent on speed” option and\r\nencourage the “designing within the browser” workflow. If you are getting\r\nregular updates on progress, you will be able to learn about how long\r\ncertain views are taking compared to others. I am curious to know how they\r\nare spending their hours if you have already done the wireframes and they\r\naren’t going to be reworking against usability testing. It should be pretty\r\nfast if they are only getting it in the browser using their existing style\r\nconventions since you don’t have an established brand, yet.\r\n\r\nAs for development, I’m less concerned about setup as I am functional\r\nvalue. If they are able to deliver all the functionality in the wireframe\r\nfor less than $10k, that sounds like a bargain by American standards.\r\n\r\nHappy to keep talking through this to help you make decisions!\r\n\r\nOn Wed, Jan 4, 2017 at 11:24 PM, Peter Hood <peter@peterhood.com> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Matt,\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> As per our IM chat, here is the last email in the thread.\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> A few things about this:\r\n>\r\n> ·         It is for the SaaS framework/plumbing, as per my XD (PDF\r\n> version of it attached)\r\n>\r\n> ·         They will present final design as static HTML/CSS and hand over\r\n> to developer to implement into the application.

I included my notes on most of the outstanding work in\r\nthe README.md file in that repo. I also coded some low hanging fruit like\r\nthe Google map, but we’ll need to swap the API key since it’s using mine.\r\nI’m sure more details will come out of your meeting, but be sure to take a\r\nlook at it when you get a chance. Ricky, we’ll need to add you to that repo\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

    "body": "## Prayer something\r\n\r\n1. Pattern - Confession Adoration Thanksgiving Supplication\r\n2. Plan - alone, kneel, posture of humility (interlock hands), pray out\r\nloud, with a list, pattern\r\n3. Partner - the hardest moment in prayer is the first moment\r\n4. Pace\r\n5. Particulars - if prodigal, pray for the day of trouble; if discouraged,\r\npray for one of God’s promises to be especially true for today\r\n\r\n## 1a) Pray for emotional health\r\n\r\n- James 5:13 - A rhetorical question is where the answer is obvious. Is\r\nanyone among you suffering? Is anyone cheerful?\r\n- Suffering translation = enduring evil treatment from people.\r\n- Present imperative, Let him pray / sing praise.\r\n- Cheerful translation = A positive, hopeful outlook.\r\n\r\n**In suffering and celebration, your choice to pray and praise has\r\nimmediate and lasting rewards in your emotional health.**\r\n\r\n- You’re connecting that to…, and it will be rewarded.\r\n\r\n- It will be rewarded with relief\r\n- If you are suffering and you pray, if you’re…\r\n- If it’s a burden, it will be gone. You will experience peace.\r\n\r\n1. Relief - burden left\r\n2. Peace - burden lifted\r\n3. Joy - burden answered\r\n4. Faith - re: future burdens\r\n5. Confidence - re: unknown burdens\r\n\r\nActs 16?\r\n\r\n1. Tell God how you feel - we tell God what’s happening because He wants to\r\nknow that we know that He knows\r\n2. Ask Him to search your heart for why - is it unresolved sin, does my\r\nheart need to change?\r\n3. Turn your thoughts towards God - count your blessings,\r\n4. Read a song of praise and thanksgiving\r\n\r\n[I tried to answer my own prayer.] If you’re going to leave it with God,\r\nleave it with God.\r\n\r\n## 2a) Pray for physical health\r\n\r\n- Sick person makes the call\r\n- We believe in a plurality of elders, elders is plural there and I think\r\nthat’s important\r\n- Their purpose for going is not to anoint with oil, their purpose for\r\ngoing is not to heal, their purpose for going is to pray.\r\n\r\nAnointing with oil?\r\n- Medicinal? No.\r\n- Figurative? No.\r\n- Symbolic? Yes, of the Holy Spirit. Symbols matter. We don’t have a lot of\r\nsymbols. Cross. Pulpit (centrality of God’s word).\r\n\r\nAll prayer is a prayer of faith. There will be a result from it.\r\n\r\nBiblical purposes for sickness\r\n\r\nAll sickness is not from sin\r\n\r\n1. To glorify God - John 9:2–3\r\n2. To teach humility - 2 Corinthians 12:7–10\r\n3. To refine our character - Job 23:10\r\n4. To convict about gross sin - 1 Corinthians 11:27–30\r\n\r\nin some self-flatulation of sin… that we will delight in grace?\r\n\r\n4 points on healing\r\n\r\n1. God does not make us sick or give disease except as a consequence of sin\r\n2. God does use every hardship we face for our Good\r\n3. God does heal people to bring glory to His name, to relieve a trial that\r\nis too heavy\r\n4. ?\r\n\r\n## 3a) Pray for spiritual health\r\n\r\nIt doesn’t have to be some incantation, we are not convincing God, He is\r\nalready willing.\r\n"

[criticized for having sex the previous night]\r\n\r\n## This morning\r\n\r\n3. “You still haven’t put up the curtains. I have been asking you for 14\r\nmonths.”\r\n4. “Yes, you should shave. I like seeing your face better.”\r\n5. “What are we doing for our anniversary?” · Unspoken context: I know you\r\nhaven’t made plans for our anniversary, yet.\r\n6. “We should take Maely to my parents and go to St. Louis.” · Unspoken\r\ncontext: You don’t do enough fun things for me like Eric does for Sabriah\r\n\r\n## During fight\r\n\r\n7. “You aren’t a loving dictator, and you are only spiritual when you need\r\nto [make a point].” (paraphrase)\r\n8. “You aren’t fun anymore.” · Unspoken context: You need to change because\r\nI want to be with someone who is fun.\r\n9. “I want to leave right now, and you obviously aren’t coming.” · Unspoken\r\ncontext: You are the one who is keeping us from going to church, and I am\r\nbetter than you for being ready to go.\r\n10. “You are insecure.” · Unspoken context: I am not.\r\n11. “All you do is complain and I don’t want to be around that.”\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy complaint is that you rarely admit when you are cruel or verbally\r\nabusive. I have other minor complaints (money, work, etc.), but nothing\r\ncomes close in weight to this. I am stubborn. I am outspoken. I am brazen\r\nto a fault, but I am not cruel.\r\n\r\ncruel - willfully causing pain or suffering to others, or feeling no\r\nconcern about it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nVerbal abuse is described as a negative defining statement told to the\r\nvictim or about the victim, or *by withholding any response, thereby\r\ndefining the target as non-existent*. If the abuser does not immediately\r\napologize and retract the defining statement, the relationship may be a\r\nverbally abusive one.\r\n\r\nIn couple relationships, the verbal abuser responds to the partner's\r\n\"separateness,\" i.e., independent thoughts, views, desires, feelings,\r\nexpressions (even of happiness) as an irritant or even an attack. While\r\nsome people believe the abuser has low self-esteem and so attempts to place\r\ntheir victim in a similar position, i.e., to believe negative things about\r\nthemselves, this is not usually the case in couple relationships. One\r\npartner may, for example, disparage the other simply because that one\r\npartner has qualities that were disparaged, e.g., emotional intelligence,\r\nwarmth, receptivity, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAnyone can experience verbal abuse. Typically, in couple or family\r\nrelationships, verbal abuse increases in intensity and frequency over time.\r\nAfter exposure to verbal abuse, victims may develop clinical depression\r\nand/or post-traumatic stress disorder. The person targeted by verbal abuse\r\nover time may succumb to any stress related illness. Verbal abuse creates\r\nemotional pain and mental anguish in its target.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI know you think I am the one who verbally abuses you, but I think I am\r\nresponding to your negative defining statements in a state of mental\r\nanguish which is typically aggressive and hasty. We need to deal with this\r\ntogether responsibly. My recommendation is to see a counselor, but you\r\nshould also be able to speak to me openly and honestly about this.\r\n\r\nMaely needs us to keep growing. By ignoring this, we have been stagnant in\r\nour sanctification.\r\n\r\nI love you so deeply. Always.\r\n"

I know that I was initially scheduled to be complete June 20, and\r\nmy time was extended to July 17.  Which I still don't understand.\r\n\r\nI have completed the requirements for both the ruby/rails, front end, and\r\nthe portfolio.  Does that mean I am technically complete to where Bloc\r\nviews me as successfully completing the full stack web developer program??\r\n\r\nIs the career prep required?? I know I mentioned I was seeking employment\r\npost Bloc, but given the lack of Bloc connection with employers in my area\r\nand Bloc not wanting to stake their reputation on reaching out to employers\r\non my behalf because my first mock interview did not go well.  I would like\r\nto be complete with Bloc and continue my employment search independently.\r\nI have already started applying and reaching out to employers and have\r\nreceived positive feedback.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if Bloc views my status as having  completed The Full\r\nStack Web Developer Track at this point.\r\n\r\nThank you Matt for your time,\r\nKayli Hamilton\r\n"

I’m looking to move a project off of my company and onto a\r\nfreelancer. It’s a WordPress site build for a newspaper in Massachusetts.\r\nGood chunk of the work is already done.\r\n\r\nDevelopment site: http://berkshire.telegraphicsinc.com/\r\n\r\nRemaining tasks includes:\r\n• Content Transfer (importer already built)\r\n• Ad System Setup (broadstreetads.com)\r\n• Calendar area (linking up events + categories)\r\n• Editorial Area Updates\r\n• Some QA Testing\r\n• A bunch of other random stuff they’ll probably come up with\r\n\r\nWe were going to try and finish the site for an additional $12k — which,\r\nthey agreed to. BUT, I think they’d be better off working with an\r\nindependent developer to have more of a one-on-one relationship for the\r\nthings they want to do.\r\n\r\nMy guess is you can charge hourly, probably up to $10k, at least. Which,\r\nthere shouldn’t be THAT much left to do. If you guys are, or if you think\r\nsomeone might be able to handle it, I’d appreciate it.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nHope it works out!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt\r\n"

Yesterday, I got an email from them saying that I do match with what they're looking for and that I'm now in their featured marketplace and eligible for a signing bonus. \r\n\r\nAnyways, just wanted to let you know what I've been up to on my end.

Since you’ve been at this awhile now, I’d say it’s time to allow a recruiter to get you placed into regular interviews. They make money on your back, but at this point, it would be better for you to start getting interview experience anyways. The good news is, New York has the most tech jobs available. I’m not familiar with the better staffing agencies in NYC, but you could try some of these:\r\n\r\nhttps://vitamintalent.com/find-work (a division of https://aquent.com)\r\nhttp://52ltd.com\r\nhttp://www.the80twenty.com\r\nhttp://www.jobspringpartners.com/tech-jobs/new-york\r\nhttp://www.workbridgeassociates.com (Same company as Jobspring)\r\n\r\nYou should also go to this event: http://www.meetup.com/techinmotionnyc/events/224406969/\r\n\r\nThe idea here is to have a person advocating for you around the clock until you’ve been placed. Be specific about the position you are looking for. It’s okay to have more than one agent, but things can get hectic really fast. I worked with Jobspring here in Chicago and my agent (one person) had me in a dozen in-person interviews in the first 2 weeks.\r\n\r\nLet me know when you’ve found an agent you like working with.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMatt Born\r\nSent with Airmail\r\n\r\nOn September 24, 2015 at 9:09:16 AM, Alberto Guillermo de la Cruz (agdelax@gmail.com) wrote:\r\n\r\nHi Matt,\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some advice. I've sent maybe 30 job applications so far, some reaches but most were Junior Designer roles or even internships that I meet the requirements for. Thing is, I haven't heard back from any place that I've applied to, which is a little disheartening. I did receive a rejection letter from Percolate saying I'm not what they're looking for despite meeting their candidate criteria, but I was thankful just to have even received a response. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if there was anything wrong with my approach. I'm attaching my resume and a sample cover letter, having taken your advice in trying communicate more about why I'd like to apply at said company. It could also be my portfolio isn't up to snuff. I'm going to a startup job fair tomorrow, so hopefully I'll have a little more success there since I'd be meeting people in person. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAlberto"

Matt works on the Bambu team within Sprout and has ample experience mentoring and remote teaching. \r\n\r\nMatt, as you already know Christine is Nick's friend and is looking to learn more JavaScript and front end design/development. \r\n\r\nThanks you both! Let me know if either of you need anything else ... I'll leave ya two to chat!\r\n\r\nLorena :-D\r\n\r\n--\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nLorena Mesa\r\nwww.lorenamesa.com\r\n\r\n\"If you wish to make apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe,\" - Carl Sagan\r\n\r\nPlease stop  before printing this email unnecessarily, think green!!!"

This offense occurred 6 years ago and I have completed all the requirements of my probation, but I’m sure this will come up during your check. I have had no problem finding and landing jobs since then with the exception of the Chicago Sun Times which was understandable given they are a major media outlet. My question to you guys then is which types of offenses and circumstances would lead to someone being ineligible to work for Postmates?\r\n\r\nI’d be happy to answer any questions and share more details about my offense, but I figure it’s better to give you guys a heads up to avoid any surprises.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time! I’ll be looking forward to your response. Also, I would appreciate your discretion when forwarding / escalating this email.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMatt Born\r\nSent with Airmail"

AngularJS being optional opens the door to some interesting possibilities and developing locally is something I’ve been advocating for. For now, feel free to keep moving on the Vagrant environment + early foundation checkpoints b/c it will still be valuable to understand both sides.\r\n\r\n-- \r\nMatt Born\r\nSent with Airmail"
